First project uses a basic HTML program to build a "CAT PHOTOS WEBSITE".
<br>
-->It has photos which are clickable.
<br>
-->It has various radio boxes and checkboxes.
<br>
-->It also contains a submit button for more cat photos submission.
<br>
PS: This project was a part of a course taught by (https://www.freecodecamp.org/). I took inspiration from it and made my own version of it.<br>

Y'all can have a look. I am open for more suggestions to make this better.
