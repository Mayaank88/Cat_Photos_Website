First project uses a basic HTML program to build a "CAT PHOTOS WEBSITE".
-->It has photos which are clickable.
-->It has various radio boxes and checkboxes.
-->It also contains a subit button for more cat photos submission.

Y'all can have a look. I am open for more suggestions to make this better.
